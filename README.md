I'm happy to share a project I've recently been working on, inspired by Spotify's yearly "Wrapped" feature. This project revolves around my own Spotify listening history and aims to provide insights into my music preferences and habits.

The project involved utilising Python and Tableau to create an user-friendly interactive web-based dashboard that offers insights and visualisations that bring my entire Spotify music journey to life, covering a span of four years from 2019 to 2022.

Leveraging Python's data manipulation capabilities in Jupyter Notebooks, I processed and cleaned the extracted JSON data obtained from Spotify by request. The Python libraries used: pandas, os, requests, glob and pytz allowed me to ensured the accuracy and consistency of the data for subsequent analysis and visualisation in Tableau.

To enhance the depth of analysis, I took advantage of Spotify's API to extract additional data on track audio features, embedded URLs, and release dates. These datasets were integrated using relationships within Tableau's data model.

You can explore the dashboard here: [(https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maxwell.bernard/viz/SpotifyListeningHistory_16859605468160/WebDashboard)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maxwell.bernard/viz/SpotifyListeningHistory_16859605468160/WebDashboard) 

This dashboard provides a visually appealing and immersive experience. By clicking on the years, icons, song titles, dynamic bars and embedded song previews, you can filter and navigate through the rest of the dashboard.

Feel free to dive in, click around, and discover the insights and visualisations that bring my music preferences to life. It's been a fun and rewarding experience working on this project and and I'm excited to work on some more projects in the future. Enjoy the tunes!
